**Big things are happening — and this is just the beginning. 🚀**

I’m excited to share a project that has been quietly taking shape with a group of **brilliant and highly motivated students from Codels Institution**.

We’re working on **Refuah Connect** — an open-source platform originally developed by an amazing developer from India (full credit to him and his team). After years of inactivity, we made a bold choice: instead of building from scratch, we decided to **revive, re-engineer, and redefine it from the ground up**.

## 🔧 What We’re Doing

I’ve already:

* Retrieved and analyzed the full source code
* Fixed major dependency and compatibility issues
* Got the application fully up and running again

Now comes the real work: redefining every layout, restructuring sections, and improving usability and performance.

## 👥 Team Structure

**Intermediate Team**

* Core functionality
* UI/UX direction
* Backend development (PHP & MySQL)

**Junior Team**

* Interactive interfaces
* Action buttons & UI components
* Profile pages and user-facing features

Each team has clear responsibilities and real ownership of what they’re building.

## ⏳ Timeline

This is a **6+ month hands-on program**, focused on real-world collaboration, clean code, and production-level thinking.

## 🌱 Looking Ahead

This phase is about building the foundation. The bigger vision for Refuah Connect will reveal itself in time.

**GitHub Repository (new):**

## 🙌 Gratitude

Huge appreciation to the students committing their time, energy, and curiosity to this journey. Some of them are already on LinkedIn and will be tagged here — they deserve the spotlight.

This isn’t just a project. It’s mentorship, teamwork, and vision in motion.

**Refuah Connect — a space to breathe, share, and find clarity.**
